# Simulations2D Framework
A .NET Core library for creating simple visual simulations that require moving objects in a 2D world. This project was mainly created as a base for [evolution simulations](https://github.com/Windore/EvolutionSimulation) but can be used for other similiar simulations as well.
## Examples
A simple example of this framework can be seen [here](src/Windore.Simulations2D.TestApp/). It contains written comments that explain at least partially how to write a simulation.
Another example is [the evolution simulation](https://github.com/Windore/EvolutionSimulation).
