# Simulations2D Framework
A .NET Core library for creating simple visual simulations that require moving objects in a 2D world. Create a SimulationScene and add SimulationObjects to interact with each other. Easily draw the simulation to window. Manage the state of the simulation with a SimulationManager. Note that this framework is not intentended for physics simulations.
## Getting Started
A guide will be added soon.
### Supported platforms
- Windows
- Linux (Requires packages sfml and csfml to be installed)

Macs should work but are untested.
## Tutorial
Tutorial will be added soon.
## Examples
A simple example of this framework can be seen [here](src/Windore.Simulations2D.ExampleApp/).
