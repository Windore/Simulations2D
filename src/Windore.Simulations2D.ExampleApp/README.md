# Example project
This is an example project containing the key features of Simulations2D. The project will contain comments explaining what is being done but if you wish to see a more in depth explanation see the [tutorial](../../tutorial.md)

The idea of this project is to create a small very unrealistic infection simulation. Basically the simulation contains 1000 uninfected objects and 100 infected objects. The creatures will move randomly and infect others or die.

## NOTE
The simulation will go faster as there are fewer SimulationObjects left. However, this doesn't mean that the movement speed or infection spreading speed changes. Instead the calculation power the simulation requires decreases and your computer is able to process more simulation changes in a second.
